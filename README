README

This is my first GitHub project, as it is the first problem I have found that I think I can solve.
My goal is to make the field trip process easier for eveyone at any school who has to deal with manual permission slips when there are so much more elegant and automatic solutions out there. If I can make a working shell site, then maybe Skyward will give mw API integration so I can make this project a reality.
My goal is not to make a fully working product, but simply a concept for others to build on.
I will add more information to this README as it is needed.
